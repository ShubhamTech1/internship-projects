1] Text Extraction from retail store Bills:

- **Description:** The project aims to develop an automated text extraction system for retail store invoices, using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system will feature a natural user interface allowing to upload diverse invoice formats, including scanned images and digital documents. Key data fields such as invoice numbers, dates, product details, and amounts will be accurately extracted, promoting efficiency in data entry processes.

- **Technologies Used:**
  - **Programming Language:** Python
  - **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-Learn, Open CV, OCR
  - **Data Manipulation and Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
  - **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - **Jupyter Notebooks:** Used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model Building
  - **Model Deployment:** streamlit, flask

- **Objectives:**
  1. Automate the extraction of essential information from retail receipts or invoices to streamline data capture processes.
  2. Ensure high accuracy and robustness in extracting item details, prices, dates, and other relevant data from various store bill formats.
  3. Develop scalability to efficiently handle large transaction volumes while seamlessly integrating with existing business workflows and software applications.
  4. Enable the storage of extracted data in a tabular format, facilitating analysis for accounting, billing, and inventory management purposes.
  5. Support forecasting of future customer trends through comprehensive data analysis, aiding in strategic decision-making processes.
